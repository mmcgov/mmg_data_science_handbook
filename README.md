Notes on setup and usage of wide array of data science applications.<br>

I have built this notebook up over a number of years as a document of my learnings as a data scientist. I have particularly focused on setup and installation as this is usually an infrequent task and it can be easy to forget the bug fixes etc that were used on the initial installation. This is particularly the case around spark/pyspark where the setup is somewhat more complex than other packages etc.

    "Essentially the steps are summarised below.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to the Powerline Fonts Github page https://github.com/powerline/fonts<br>\n",
    "2. Click on the green “Clone or download” button.<br>\n",
    "3. Click “Download ZIP”<br>\n",
    "4. Save the file fonts-master.zip to your Downloads folder or wherever you want to put it.<br>\n",
    "5. Extract fonts-master.zip.<br>\n",
    "6. Go into the fonts-master folder and the other fonts-master folder inside that. Rather than opening each folder and trying to install each font file ending with .ttf or .otf with the Windows Font Viewer, we will use a PowerShell batch script ( .ps1) called install.ps1. But a few things need to be done to make it work.<br>\n",
    "7. You need to open PowerShell as an Administrator ( Window Key + X then select “Windows PowerShell (Admin)”. Click “Yes” when the User Access Control (UAC) prompt shows up. Because PowerShell started with the Administrator user rather than the regular user (you), PowerShell starts up in `C:\\WINDOWS\\system32 instead of C:\\Users\\${env:UserName}`, you will need to navigate to the fonts-master folder in the Downloads folder. You can do this by typing `cd ${HOME}\\Downloads\\fonts-master\\fonts-master`.<br>\n",
    "8. Next we need to tell the Execution Policy to stand down. If you don’t do this, the script won’t be allowed to run. This isn’t the same as what Linux does where the script is given execution privileges. Rather it is the inverse. The Execution Policy is a blanket approach to preventing scripts from executing. We will need to set to Execution Policy to Bypass, so that we may run this script. If you entered something else, you can reset the execution policy to Restricted later. So type Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass. You will likely be warned you are changing the Execution Policy, type y for Yes then enter.<br>\n",
    "9. Now we can run the install.ps1 file! Type .\\install.ps1. If you are Installing a newer version, you will likely be prompted for every font that is replaced. (I should look into that.) Otherwise new fonts will be installed.<br>\n",
    "10. Just to be sure, reset the Execution Policy back to the Default setting. Set-ExecutionPolicy Default then type y for Yes like before.<br>\n",

    "TO get on insider program go to `windows insider program settings`. And follow instructions to join choosing the preview build. The preview build keeps you on the main release only with some new preview features whereas the fast and slow rings move you off the main release. This is important as once you move to fast or slow rings you may need a full fresh install to get back to main release windows or wait to the next stable release comes and you can jump back. With the preview ring you dont have same issues as its still the main release only with extra bells and whistles. You can simple clikc out of it and when next stable release comes along preview updates will stop and you will automatically be back on the main release. In summary the preview release is very safe unlike the fast and slow rings.\n",

It is not currently possible to have both running simultaneously due to non-compatibility with hyper-v in virtualbox but they will probably soon update to fix this issue.

    "As a starting point git clone an existing project docker which has been productionised to get template docker setup with base image etc.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Create new git repo and use template docker with new project code inside it.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "__Making template docker project specific__<br>\n",
    "Next replace all mention of the old docker name with your new docker name. This needs to be done in a number of places see below:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Dockerfile<br>\n",
    "Dockerfile is used to build the docker including installing packages, Kerberos config setup, amazonRedshift setup, environment variables. (Can also add in volumes here as well as in docker-compose.yml file)\n",
    "\n",
    "Add in any additional packages eg Amazon Redshift drivers etc as necessary.<br>\n",
    "Installing packages within Dockerfile<br>\n",
    "Ideally should list packages in requirements.txt file and then the command below in the Dockerfile will install them:<br>\n",
    "`RUN pip3 install -r /FILEPATH/requirements/base.txt`<br>\n",
    "You can also use pip commands within the Dockerfile directly bit this is untidy and adds steps to the build process:<br>\n",
    "`RUN pip3 install selenium`<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "__Note__ if a package cannot be downloaded and installed via pip or apt in this file you can download it outside the docker and install it within this file like below. Here we downloaded twisted-17.1.0 externally and then unzipped it and installed in the Dockerfile meaning this will be done as the docker is built.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "`ADD ./Twisted-17.1.0 /FILEPATH/Twisted-17.1.0`\n",
    "`ADD ./tar_file.sh /FILEPATH/tar_file.sh`\n",
    "`RUN chmod +x /FILEPATH/tar_file.sh`\n",
    "`RUN /FILEPATH/tar_file.sh`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example the tar_file.sh is simple a bash script with the below lines to install twisted as part of the docker build process.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "`cd Twisted-17.1.0`<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Makefile\n",
    "Makefile defines list of any commands that can be passed to the docker container externally for example to use dev-bash listed below just type make dev-bash (see example below). Simply place make in front of any command to run it.<br>\n",

    "Change name of docker in this file and this must be the same as service name in the docker-compose.yml file.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Click commands\n",
    "Click commands are decorators which enable commands to be passed via the command line. See example below for how it might run a main.py script in the docker direct from command line outside the docker.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "`Python main.py batch run_main`<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The process this line starts is as follows:<br>\n",
    "•\tIt first runs the main.py file in the home directory of the docker where the click commands are stored.<br> \n",
    "•\tIt then goes into app/commands and runs run_main from the code_commands.py script<br>\n",
    "•\tThe run_main function then runs the main function inside the Code folder<br>\n",
    "•\tThis final main function runs the project code.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### App/Commands\n",
    "These use click commands just like makefile, structure of base image is that it looks here and runs the python script in this directory.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Change name of python script eg from DOCKER_NAME_commands to NEW_NAME, the main.py script goes into this directory and runs any scripts with .py suffix so name of it not that important.\n",
    "Inside script change imports to be new name eg \n",
    "From DOCKER_NAME.main import main to from NEW_NAME.main import main, this name is same as name in docker root directory where code stored in this case DOCKER_NAME.\n",
    "Change comments as necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Docker\n",
    "Holds some bash scripts that are run from Dockerfile eg unset_proxies.sh<br>\n",
    "Add in extra bash scripts and reference them in Dockerfile if required\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Change service name to new project. This same name will be used in the Makefile to launch the docker.<br>\n",
    "Change name references to code_folder to whatever name of directory containing code is called.<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "A python web application consists of the following three main components listed below (__Dash/Flask app, WSGI application server, web server__). <br>\n",
    "It is important to note that while lightweight and easy to use, Flask’s built-in server is not suitable for production as it doesn’t scale well and by default serves only one request at a time, hence the need for a application server and web server as shown below. This is the reason why when you launch a Flask/Dash app without the parts below you get the following warning<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "`Serving Flask app \"hello_flask\" (lazy loading)`<br>\n",
    "`* Environment: production`<br>\n",
    "`  WARNING: Do not use the development server in a production environment.`<br>\n",
    "`  Use a production WSGI server instead.`<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### python application (like Dash/Flask)\n",
    "This will be a python script such as the one listed later as an example in this section. This file contains the code to read in the data and to display it as a dashboard etc. It will be responsible for login authorisation as well as links between graphs and website navigation etc.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A WSGI application server (like Gunicorn)\n",
    "Gunicorn translates requests which it gets from Nginx into a format which your web application can handle, and makes sure that your code is executed when needed.<br>\n",
    "Once Nginx decides, that a particular request should be passed on to Gunicorn (due to the rules you configured it with), it’s Gunicorn’s time to shine.<br>\n",
    "Gunicorn is really great at what it does! It’s highly optimized and has a lot of convenient features. Mostly, its jobs consist of:<br>\n",
    "Running a pool of worker processes/threads (executing your code!)<br>\n",
    "Translates requests coming in from Nginx to be WSGI compatible<br>\n",
    "Translate the WSGI responses of your app into proper http responses<br>\n",
    "Actually calls your Python code when a request comes in<br>\n",
    "Gunicorn can talk to many different web servers<br>\n",
    "What Gunicorn can’t do for you:<br>\n",
    "Not prepared to be front-facing: easy to DOS and overwhelm<br>\n",
    "Can’t terminate SSL (no https handling)<br>\n",
    "Do the job of a webserver like Nginx, they are better at it<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A web server (like nginx)\n",
    "Nginx is where requests from the internet arrive first. It can handle them very quickly, and is usually configured to only let those requests through, which really need to arrive at your web application.<br>\n",
    "Nginx is a web server and reverse proxy. It’s highly optimized for all the things a web server needs to do. Here are a few things it’s great at:<br>\n",
    "Take care of domain name routing (decides where requests should go, or if an error response is in order)<br>\n",
    "Serve static files<br>\n",
    "Handle lots of requests coming in at once<br>\n",
    "Handle slow clients<br>\n",
    "Forwards requests which need to be dynamic to Gunicorn<br>\n",
    "Terminate SSL (https happens here)<br>\n",
    "Save computing resources (CPU and memory) compared to your Python code<br>\n",
    "And a lot more, if you configure it to do so (load balancing, caching, …)<br>\n",
    "Things Nginx can’t do for you:<br>\n",
    "Running Python web applications for you<br>\n",
    "Translate requests to WSGI<br>\n",
